NowAndThen: a social network-based photo recommendation tool supporting reminiscence,"['Vinh-Tiep Nguyen', 'Khanh-Duy Le', 'Minh-Triet Tran', 'Morten Fjeld']",December 2016  ,MUM '16: Proceedings of the 15th International Conference on Mobile and Ubiquitous Multimedia,"People frequently post their photos on social network sites (e.g. Facebook, Instagram) as a way to share memorable moments, emotions, or locations visited. While sharing photos with the same subjects as past photos could lead to user reminiscence and potentially create valuable benefits, existing products still cannot support this adequately. Based on a survey on user habits in sharing and revisiting photos on social network sites, we propose NowAndThen, a photo recommendation concept and tool that assists reminiscence when sharing photos on social network sites. By combining visual features of the photos and associated tags, a prototype we developed can recommend old photos that have common subjects with the user's current photos of interest. Our study with the prototype shows that this approach can help users positively revive past memories and connections with their friends. In addition, our results include various design insights and implications for future reminiscence-support systems."
Searching a specific person in a specific location using deep features,"['Vinh-Tiep Nguyen', 'Minh-Triet Tran', 'Thanh Duc Ngo', 'Duy-Dinh Le', 'Duc Anh Duong']",December 2016  ,SoICT '16: Proceedings of the Seventh Symposium on Information and Communication Technology,"Video instance search or also well known as object retrieval is a fundamental task in computer vision field and has a lot of applications. Most state-of-the-art systems are based on the Bag-of-Words model (BOW) for representing video frames and target object. When searching on nearly planar and rich-textured objects such as buildings and book cover, BOW argue to be a suitable model with very high performance. However, when searching on harder but more popular objects such as a specific person, BOW model still keep a lower performance. In this paper, we consider a new type of query which covers most popular topics: searching a person in a specific location. Inspired by recent successes of deep learning techniques, we propose new framework which leverage the powerful of both BOW model and deep feature in instance search. In particular, we use a linear kernel classifier instead of using L2 distance to compute similarity between two deep features. For further improvement, scene tracking are employed to deal with the cases face of query person is not detected. To evaluate the proposed methods, we conduct experiments over a standard benchmark dataset (TRECVID Instance Search 2016) with more than 300 GB in storage and 464 hours in duration. The results show that, our proposed methods significant improve the baseline system."
Augmented media for traditional magazines,"['Vinh-Tiep Nguyen', 'Minh-Triet Tran', 'Trung-Nghia Le', 'Quoc-Minh Bui', 'Anh-Duc Duong']",August 2012  ,SoICT '12: Proceedings of the Third Symposium on Information and Communication Technology,Reading traditional newspapers or magazines is a common way to get latest information about events or new products. However these printed materials only provide readers with static information. Readers may want to know more detail information about some product in an article or to watch video clips related to an event mentioned in a news right at the moment when they read that article or news. The authors propose a system with mobile devices that can provide extra information and multimedia for readers by applying augmented reality to traditional magazines. A user can enjoy extra rich multimedia information on a product or news on his/her mobile device just by looking at an article in a traditional magazine through his/her mobile device. The system detects which article in which page of a magazine that is being displayed in a mobile device and provides a reader with related information and multimedia objects. The important feature of our proposed system is using lightweight filter to efficiently filter out candidate covers or articles that do not visually match an image captured by a mobile device. The experiment shows that our proposed system achieves the average accuracy of more than 90% and can process in the real-time manner.
Lifelogging Retrieval based on Semantic Concepts Fusion,"['Thanh-Dat Truong', 'Tung Dinh-Duy', 'Vinh-Tiep Nguyen', 'Minh-Triet Tran']",June 2018  ,LSC '18: Proceedings of the 2018 ACM Workshop on The Lifelog Search Challenge,"Lifelogging data provides useful insight understanding about our lives during daily activities. Thus, it is essential to develop a system to assist users to retrieve events or memories from lifelogging data from ad-hoc text queries. In this paper, we first propose a method to process lifelogging data by grouping images into visual shots and clusters, then extract semantic concepts on scene category and attributes, entities, and actions. We then develop a query system that supports 4 main types of query conditions: temporal, spatial, entity and action, and extra data criteria. Our system is expected to efficiently assist users to search for past moments in daily logs."
Noise Removal Based Query Pre-processing to Improve Face Search Performance in Large Scale Video Databases,"['Hung-Quoc Vo', 'Vu-Minh-Hieu Dang', 'Vinh-Tiep Nguyen', 'Duy-Dinh Le']",December 2019  ,SoICT 2019: Proceedings of the Tenth International Symposium on Information and Communication Technology,"In most person search systems, for ease of use, a user is often required to provide only raw images that contain person as query examples without specific face location. As a result, a face detector needs to be used. However, current face detectors are robust to pose, thus using all the detected faces as query can hurt search performance. Therefore, having a good stage for removing bad examples in query can directly lead to better performance on the whole system. In this paper, we focus on analyzing how bad face examples affect person search system. Moreover, we propose an automatic bad-face removal method which is stable to the case where bad faces are dominant in a query. Experiments show that our removal method yields better mAP in both image example and shot example setting compared to that of Peking state of the art system."
Enhancing Endoscopic Image Classification with Symptom Localization and Data Augmentation,"['Trung-Hieu Hoang', 'Hai-Dang Nguyen', 'Viet-Anh Nguyen', 'Thanh-An Nguyen', 'Vinh-Tiep Nguyen', 'Minh-Triet Tran']",October 2019  ,MM '19: Proceedings of the 27th ACM International Conference on Multimedia,"Inspired by recent advances in computer vision and deep learning, we propose new enhancements to tackle problems appearing in endoscopic image analysis, especially abnormality finding and anatomical landmark detection. In details, a combination of Residual Neural Network and Faster R-CNN are jointly applied in order to take all of their advantages and improve the overall performance. Nevertheless, novel data augmentation is designed and adapted to corresponding domains. Our approaches prove their competitive results in term of not only the accuracy but also the inference time in Medico: The 2018 Multimedia for Medicine Task and The Biomedia ACM MM Grand Challenge 2019. These results show the great potential of the collaborating between deep learning models and data augmentation in medical image analysis applications. Especially, more than 4900 bounding boxes localizing the symptom of some classes from KVASIR dataset that we annotated and used in this project are shared online for future research."
Flood Level Prediction via Human Pose Estimation from Social Media Images,"['Khanh-An C. Quan', 'Vinh-Tiep Nguyen', 'Tan-Cong Nguyen', 'Tam V. Nguyen', 'Minh-Triet Tran']",June 2020  ,ICMR '20: Proceedings of the 2020 International Conference on Multimedia Retrieval,"Floods are the most common natural and among the most dangerous disasters in the world. It is important to get up-to-date information about flooding and the flood level for flood preparation and prevention. In this paper, we propose an efficient method to determine the flood level from daily activity photos on social media. Our method is based on the idea of matching the water level with human pose to determine the level of severity of flooding. Extensive experiments conducted on the dataset of Multimodal Flood Level Estimation show the superiority of our proposed method. We achieve the first rank in MediaEval 2019 and this demonstrates the potential applications of our method to analyze flood information."
"Video Indexing, Search, Detection, and Description with Focus on TRECVID","['George Awad', 'Duy-Dinh Le', 'Chong-Wah Ngo', 'Vinh-Tiep Nguyen', 'Georges Qu√©not', 'Cees Snoek', ""Shin'ichi Satoh""]",June 2017  ,ICMR '17: Proceedings of the 2017 ACM on International Conference on Multimedia Retrieval,"There has been a tremendous growth in video data the last decade. People are using mobile phones and tablets to take, share or watch videos more than ever before. Video cameras are around us almost everywhere in the public domain (e.g. stores, streets, public facilities, ...etc). Efficient and effective retrieval methods are critically needed in different applications. The goal of TRECVID is to encourage research in content-based video retrieval by providing large test collections, uniform scoring procedures, and a forum for organizations interested in comparing their results. In this tutorial, we present and discuss some of the most important and fundamental content-based video retrieval problems such as recognizing predefined visual concepts, searching in videos for complex ad-hoc user queries, searching by image/video examples in a video dataset to retrieve specific objects, persons, or locations, detecting events, and finally bridging the gap between vision and language by looking into how can systems automatically describe videos in a natural language. A review of the state of the art, current challenges, and future directions along with pointers to useful resources will be presented by different regular TRECVID participating teams. Each team will present one of the following tasks: "
Smart Lifelog Retrieval System with Habit-based Concepts and Moment Visualization,"['Nguyen-Khang Le', 'Dieu-Hien Nguyen', 'Trung-Hieu Hoang', 'Thanh-An Nguyen', 'Thanh-Dat Truong', 'Duy-Tung Dinh', 'Quoc-An Luong', 'Viet-Khoa Vo-Ho', 'Vinh-Tiep Nguyen', 'Minh-Triet Tran']",June 2019  ,LSC '19: Proceedings of the ACM Workshop on Lifelog Search Challenge,"Lifelogging is a new trend of research in which we collect and analyze people's daily activities to gain insight into people daily basis and enhance people's life quality. This leads to many research in retrieval systems to be developed for lifelogging analysis. One of the most important factors of a successful lifelogging retrieval system is to enhance the user's ability to perform any queries, even arbitrary ones. This motivates our proposal of a retrieval system in which we focus on the two main properties. The first property is the ability to accurately annotate the lifelog dataset with metadata that is meaningful for the retrieving process. The second property focuses on a powerful user interface that supports a novice user to perform the retrieval efficiently."
